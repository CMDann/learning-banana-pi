# learning-banana-pi

The Banana Pi is a single board computer which was developed as a competitor to the Raspberry Pi. There are several types now including the M1, M2, and Pro which all build off the Raspberry Pi. These boards have better specs and are a lot more useful when trying to use a GUI.

Learning Banana Pi is a book about working with the Banana Pi.
